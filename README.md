Explanation

We define a schema for the Transactions collection with a category field and a dateOfSale field.
We create an API endpoint /pie-chart/:month that takes the month as a parameter.
We use the aggregate method to process the data.
We use the $addFields stage to add a new field month to each document, which is the month of the dateOfSale field.
We use the $match stage to filter the transactions to only include those with the selected month.
We use the $group stage to group the transactions by category and count the number of items in each category.
We map the resulting data to a format that's easy to consume for the pie chart, with category and count properties.
